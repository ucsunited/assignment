# Generate steward/stewee assignments

In each text box, put one name per line and then hit "Assign!". That's it, really. Stewards need stewards, too! As such, they should be listed in staff as well.

Each time you run this, it'll generate a new list. Nothing ever gets stored anywhere or saved in any way... but you can copy and paste the results after you run it yourself.

For each location group, add a list of stewards and the corresponding staff. You'll get a list of assignments, sorted by steward, below. This doesn't take potential managerial conflicts or other considerations into account (someone could end up as their own steward, for example), it's just a starting point.

And once again, you'll get different results each time you use it. You can run a few tests to make sure you got the details formatted correctly, but it's on the honor system to say, "Ok, this is the one that counts."
